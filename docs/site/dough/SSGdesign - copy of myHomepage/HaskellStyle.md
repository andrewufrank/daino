Writing Haskell code is time consuming. Why? I experience often unnecessary complexity and 
compile time errors when using packages from others or from myself not 
adhering to expected standards. Typically:
- confusion about representation of character sequences (aka "Strings"),
- issues with directory and filenames (or url),
- diffferences in the monad used,
- obscure shortcuts and infix function names,
- ...

I try to give here some rules how to write readable Haskell
 
The overall goal is to make functionality easy to understand to assure
that I can read the code again and establish conventions on which a 
user of a package can rely. It is an attempt to reduce the choice of 
the programmer to use a specific solution to write code when Haskell 
allows many different approaches.

**Clarity - achieved by making functionality visible and providing only one way of achieving a goal.**

## Architecture

First: move all use of packages of any general usability 
(i.e. whatever you expect to use again)
into an isolation package in the "uniform" package and provide 
calls in the ErrIO monad, with inputs as Text and Path (not other 
character representation, not FilePath).

Second: Look for a top level sequence to transform data (files) from 
start (input) to result (output). Manage the overall handling of files 
with shake (removes the problem of redoing operations when something 
changes and avoiding redoing if not required). 

Third: for each transformation, separate pure operations from the IO 
related one. For the pure functions, provide test cases.

## Structure 

1. Call a second level main in ErrIO and assure errors are properly reported back.
Use, for example, the function  `startProg` from `uniform-convenience`.

2. Read command line arguments; start with nothing and add switches as 
needed.

Maintaining results up-to-date: use `uniform-watch` to re-run functions when files change.

Manage file based processing:  Use `uniform-shake` to manage files. 

### Testing while development
For each module start a corresponding module in the `tests` directory. 
Whenever a function is not immediately producing the correct result, 
produce a test case and leave it to re-test always. 

or the IO bound major operations, use regression testing to keep overall
functionality (at least for the test case) assured. If bugs are discovered, 
add a test case.


## Use do notation
There are nice ways to combine monads leading to very short and elegant 
code. In my experience they are hard to read and understand. 

Example: the first lines of a main from `bibtex`: 
```
main :: IO ()
main =
   do bib <- getContents
      case Parsec.parse (Parsec.skipMany Parsec.space >> Parse.file) "stdin" bib of
         Left errMsg -> hPutStrLn stderr (show errMsg)
         Right entries ->
            mapM_ (putStrLn . cite) entries
```

The difficulty is that elegance implies much is not said and must be 
reconstructed by a potential user. 

## write type annotations 
Whenever writing code and you know the type of a symbol, annotate it.
It reduces "ambiguous type error", checks statically against mistakes 
and makes understanding code later when searching for errors or reading 
the code of others easier. 

## document the intention of functions
Between the type of a function and the code insert a comment line (with `-- ^`)  to 
inform yourself and future users what should be achieved and why.

## packages export types and required support functions
Reduce the number of imports by exporting in a package all functions and 
types a user will automatically need to use these functions (and 
annotate the types). 

## isolate seldom used Haskell features  
There are very elegant solutions, for example lenses, to get and set 
values in JSON records with a few inline functions. Isolate such functions in 
a single location and pack into ordinary functions which are documented and 
exported.

In particular, avoid in general code:
- lenses
- type level programming
- template haskell

## handling of directory and filenames 
Shake seems to include a nearly complete set of functions to handle directory and file names; perhaps I should always use this set?
