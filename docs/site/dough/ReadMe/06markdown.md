## Markdown can include images, reference etc.

Markdown allow the inclusion of images, bibliographic references etc. 

<!-- todo explain images references etc -->

References are always `absolute` with respect to the root^[starting with a "/"] or `relative` to the current page^[not starting with "/"]. Additional files can be collected in `resources` directories^[`resources` is a reserved word; all other directory names are treated as content directories].

<!-- todo - what happens with an directory without an index file? -->
