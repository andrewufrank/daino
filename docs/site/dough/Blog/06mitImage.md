06mimage text with an image in the banner version1234

the image is in /home/frank/Workspace11/ssg/docs/site/dough/Blog/resources/120-2026_IMG.JPG i.e. in a directory parallel to file

and found with image: /Blog/resources/120-2026_IMG.JPG

Some text without meaning; really? with an image 

the [pdf_file](/Blog/resources/blogtest.pdf)

probably a ref [alternate](./resources/blogtest.pdf)

In the pdf for the blog only the alternate is found!
