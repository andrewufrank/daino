This is the `index page` at the root of the site. 

It gives 

- a  brief description of the site (produced by the site author as markdown text in the file), and
- an automatically produced list of the pages (i.e. `md` files) in the directory as clickable (navigable) links. 

It shows the default images in the banner (the file listed in the `settings` page as `banner`, the site name and the site byline)g
Under the banner image a ribbon gives link to the top level subdirectories (as given in the `menuitems` entry  in the `settings` page) and a link to the top level index. This ribbon is added to each page. 

<!-- todo add a return button -->

At the bottom of each page the name of `html` file shown, which is typically the same as the name of the `md` file from which the html is produced (the `html` in the `baked` the `md`` in the `dough`directory).

The pages under `Blog` give examples for diffferent case of web pages and how they can be expressed in markdown.
